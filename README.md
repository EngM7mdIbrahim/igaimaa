<p id="description">My Learning Management System (LMS) that is built with a team I was managing is streamlines communication between teachers and students by providing a centralized platform for course plans. Each course on the LMS includes a variety of activities such as homework and quizzes which are supported by a question bank featuring multiple question types. The system also includes live sessions that are automatically corrected and integrated with a separate platform called "Let's Meet" for easy sharing of materials as well as the ability to embed external materials using iframes. Additionally the LMS offers messaging and texting functionality to facilitate communication between teachers and students.</p>
